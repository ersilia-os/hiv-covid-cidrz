# HIV treatment during COVID in Zambia

This repository contains code for the analysis of country-wide data on HIV treatment in Zambia prior and post-COVID times.

## Background

The goal of this project is to identify the potential effect of COVID-19 waves in Zambia on HIV treatment. A large-scale chunk of the Zambia's SmartCare database was pulled, containing viral load data across the country from the period 2017-2023. This work is done in collaboration with [Jake Pry](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pBsLLnoAAAAJ&hl=en) ([CIDRZ](https://www.cidrz.org/)).
